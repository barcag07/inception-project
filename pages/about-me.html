                            My name is Gerardo Garcia, but I also go by Andy. I am 24 years old, and this is my 2nd semester here at the College of the Mainland. From 2017 to 2022, I attended the University of St. Thomas in Houston, where I played on the Men’s soccer team for four years. I didn’t really know what I wanted to study and ended up changing my major three times from biology to general business, and finally to finance, but I did not graduate. I had a year left but decided to take a break and change my major again. That's when I came to COM, and I'm currently majoring in Computer Science. It's been pretty cool so far, and I'm certain that this is what I want to finish studying.

                                    I am a pretty active person. I used to play soccer about five times a week, whether it was indoor or outdoor. However, this semester has been more demanding, so I have not been able to play at all. I still take my dog on walks at the park when I have spare time. When I am not doing anything active, I love to sit down and relax. Playing video games like FIFA, Assassin's Creed, and Battlefield 1 is one of my hobbies. Additionally, I enjoy watching anime and reading manga, with my favorite being One Piece. This show is about a pirate who travels island to island, liberating people, fighting a corrupt world government, competing against other pirates to find the ultimate treasure, and attempting to unravel the mystery of a 100-year-old void in history. I like watching TV shows and movies. Some of my favorite shows include The Office and Arrested Development. I love all kinds of movies, from old comedies like Airplane to action-packed ones like John Wick, but my all-time favorite movie would have to be Interstellar.

                                    This semester has been my most difficult one so far at COM. I am taking philosophy, biology 2, programming fundamentals 2, and calculus 1. The two classes that are giving me the most trouble are biology 2 and calculus 1. Biology 2 is an interesting class, but there is a lot of memorization and a significant amount of time required for studying. Calculus isn’t difficult, but it isn’t easy either. A good amount of time is needed to fully understand what we are learning in class. I like my computer fundamentals class because it’s all programming and writing code. I am very interested in programming, so learning new concepts has been pretty easy for me so far. This philosophy class is very interesting. I took other philosophy classes at my previous school, but I enjoy this one a lot more. The main difference is that this class is more hands-on. Instead of just learning from a book, we learned how philosophy impacts the world every day with real world examples, and watching The Matrix was a cool bonus.

                                    I hope to graduate from COM in this coming spring, if not in the summer, and transfer to the University of Houston’s main campus. There, I will be pursuing a bachelor’s degree in computer science. This summer, I will try to get an internship as a frontend developer making websites. In the future, I hope to be a web developer or software developer.
