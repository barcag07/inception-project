        <p class="p3"><span class="s1">The subject of reality has been highly debated for centuries, with famous opinions from philosophers such as Plato, Aristotle, and Descartes. The idea of reality is still as mysterious as it was when first introduced centuries ago, leaving many questions unanswered. Each person has their own unique perception of what 'reality' is. Different takes on reality are a common theme in many popular movies and TV shows that have come out throughout the years. The Christopher Nolan movie Inception is known for its great cast, but the movie is also known to be riddled with philosophical elements. Throughout the movie, instances of Plato’s allegory of the cave, along with some of his other theories on reality, can be found. A quick summary of what reality is, Plato’s allegory, what Plato’s thoughts on the subject are, and a quick summary of the film will help demonstrate how they are tied together in the movie Inception.</span></p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s1">            Reality is part of the philosophical branch Metaphysics. Metaphysics deals with questions about what reality is, what is real, and what it means to exist. Reality refers to things the way they really are</span></p>
